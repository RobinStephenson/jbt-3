## Using our project
- Our project utilises Gradle, we highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE as we've already set up all the Run Configrations you'll need for it
- To load the project ensure you have gradle installed, and when prompted by IDEA to import a new project, navigate to the build.gradle in the main directory and import all gradle builds when selected.
- If you have any issues drop one of us a message and we should be able to help out.
